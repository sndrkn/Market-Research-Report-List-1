<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Grade Silicon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski (CZ) Method</li><li>Float Zone (FZ) Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The optical grade silicon market is divided into two main types: Czochralski (CZ) Method and Float Zone (FZ) Method. The CZ method involves melting high-purity silicon in a crucible and then slowly pulling a single crystal ingot out of the molten material. This process yields large cylindrical crystals suitable for optical applications. On the other hand, the FZ method involves placing a small seed crystal in contact with molten silicon and then slowly raising the seed while rotating it, creating a crystal ingot without introducing impurities. These methods are both used to produce high-quality silicon for optical devices.</p></p>
