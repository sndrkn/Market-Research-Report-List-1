<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plasma Arc Cutting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weak Current</li><li>Strong Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plasma arc cutting is divided into two market types: weak current and strong current. In weak current plasma arc cutting, an electric arc is created between the electrode and the workpiece using low power settings. This method is typically used for precision cutting of thin materials, producing high-quality cuts with minimal heat-affected zones. On the other hand, strong current plasma arc cutting involves a higher power setting, creating a more intense electric arc. This method is suitable for cutting thicker materials and achieving faster cutting speeds, but it may result in wider heat-affected zones.</p></p>
