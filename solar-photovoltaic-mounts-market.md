<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Photovoltaic Mounts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracking Mount</li><li>Fixed Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar photovoltaic mounts market consists of two main types: tracking mounts and fixed mounts. Tracking mounts are designed to move and follow the sun's trajectory throughout the day, maximizing the amount of solar energy captured. This ensures optimal efficiency but comes at a higher cost due to the complexity of the system. On the other hand, fixed mounts are stationary and do not move. While they are simpler and less expensive to install, they may not capture as much solar energy as tracking mounts.</p></p>
