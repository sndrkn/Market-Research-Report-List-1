<p><h1>Drug-Eluting Balloon Market Insights, Market Players and Forecast Till 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>A drug-eluting balloon (DEB) is a medical device used in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, most commonly in the field of interventional cardiology. It consists of a balloon catheter that is coated with an anti-restenotic drug, such as Paclitaxel or Sirolimus. When the balloon is inflated inside a narrowed or blocked artery, the drug is released and helps to prevent the re-narrowing of the artery.</p><p>The future outlook for the drug-eluting balloon market is promising. The growing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, is driving the demand for innovative treatment options. DEBs offer advantages over traditional balloon angioplasty and bare-metal stents, such as reduced risk of restenosis and the need for repeat procedures.</p><p>Moreover, advancements in balloon coating technologies and drug delivery systems are enhancing the effectiveness and safety profile of DEBs. The development of bioresorbable coatings and combination therapies with other drugs is expected to further expand the market.</p><p>The current outlook of the drug-eluting balloon market is positive. It has witnessed significant growth over the years, and this trend is expected to continue. The increasing adoption of minimally invasive procedures and the rising geriatric population are contributing to the market's growth. Additionally, the introduction of new DEB products by key players and the expansion of their distribution networks are fueling market expansion.</p><p>However, the market also faces challenges such as stringent regulatory requirements and concerns over the long-term safety of drug-eluting balloons. Nevertheless, with ongoing technological advancements and increasing clinical evidence supporting their effectiveness, the drug-eluting balloon market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% during the forecast period.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drug-Eluting Balloon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Drug-Eluting Balloon (DEB) market can be categorized into two types: Type I and Type II. Type I DEB involves the use of paclitaxel-coated balloons, which release an anti-proliferative drug to prevent the recurrence of arterial blockages. On the other hand, Type II DEB consists of balloons coated with other drugs, such as sirolimus or everolimus, which also inhibit cell proliferation. Both types aim to deliver highly effective treatments for arterial diseases, reducing the need for repeat interventions and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
