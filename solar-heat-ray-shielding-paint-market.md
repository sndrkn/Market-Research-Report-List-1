<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Heat-ray Shielding Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Ray Reflection</li><li>Heat Ray Absorption</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solar heat-ray shielding paint is a type of paint that helps regulate the temperature inside buildings by reflecting or absorbing solar heat rays. Heat ray reflection paint reflects the majority of the heat rays, preventing them from entering the building. On the other hand, heat ray absorption paint absorbs the heat rays, reducing their impact on the interior temperature. Both types of paints serve the purpose of minimizing the amount of heat that enters the building, thus enhancing energy efficiency and reducing the need for cooling systems.</p></p>
