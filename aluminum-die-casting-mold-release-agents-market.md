<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Die-casting Mold Release Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water based</li><li>Solvent based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aluminum die-casting mold release agents market can be divided into two types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based mold release agents are formulated by emulsifying a lubricating agent in water, making them environmentally friendly and easy to clean. Solvent-based mold release agents, on the other hand, are made by dissolving a lubricating agent in an organic solvent. These agents provide excellent lubrication and release properties but are not as environmentally friendly as water-based agents. The choice between these two types depends on specific application requirements and environmental concerns.</p></p>
