<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Mask Polypropylene Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>≤35 g/10 min</li><li>> 35 g/10 min</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Mask Polypropylene Fiber market can be divided into two types based on the melt flow rate (MFR) of the fiber. MFR represents the rate at which the fiber can be extruded during manufacturing. The first type is classified as ≤35 g/10 min, meaning the fiber has a lower MFR, indicating slower extrusion. The second type is classified as >35 g/10 min, indicating a higher MFR and faster extrusion. These classifications are relevant in determining the suitability of the fiber for specific medical mask manufacturing processes.</p></p>
