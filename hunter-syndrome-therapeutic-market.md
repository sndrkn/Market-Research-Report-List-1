<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hunter Syndrome Therapeutic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular (ICV)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hunter Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder causing the deficiency of enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, leading to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the body. Therapeutic interventions include replacing the missing enzyme through intravenous (IV) infusion or administering it directly into the cerebrospinal fluid via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. IV market refers to the use of infusion therapy for enzyme delivery, targeting systemic symptoms. ICV market focuses on delivering the enzyme directly to the brain and spinal cord, aiming to alleviate neurological issues. Both approaches aim to address different aspects of Hunter Syndrome manifestations.</p></p>
