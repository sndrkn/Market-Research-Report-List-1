<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magneto-Rheological Dampers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Dampers</li><li>Semi Active Dampers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magneto-Rheological (MR) dampers are advanced devices used to control suspension systems in vehicles. They can be classified into two main types: active dampers and semi-active dampers. Active dampers continuously adjust damping force based on real-time feedback from sensors. They require complex control systems and are expensive. On the other hand, semi-active dampers have adjustable damping force but do not require complex control systems. They are more cost-effective and commonly used in vehicles. Both types enhance ride comfort, stability, and handling by swiftly responding to changes in road conditions.</p></p>
