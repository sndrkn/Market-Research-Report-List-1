<p><strong>The Cuttings Re-injection Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dedicated Injection</li><li>Annular Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cuttings re-injection services involve the process of injecting drilled cuttings back into the earth. Dedicated injection is a market type where a specifically designed well is used solely for cuttings disposal. This method requires a separate injection well to ensure the safe disposal of the cuttings. On the other hand, annular injection is a market type that involves injecting the cuttings into the annular space between the drill pipe and wellbore. This method provides a cost-effective alternative to dedicated injection by utilizing the existing well structure for cuttings disposal.</p></p>
