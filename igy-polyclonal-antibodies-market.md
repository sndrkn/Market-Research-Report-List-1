<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IGY Polyclonal Antibodies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Antibody</li><li>Secondary Antibody</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IGY polyclonal antibodies market consists of two main types: primary antibodies and secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies are produced by injecting antigens into hens, which then naturally produce antibodies against the antigens. These primary antibodies can directly bind to specific target proteins in research or diagnostic applications. Secondary antibodies are generated by injecting purified primary antibodies into animals, such as rabbits or goats, which produce antibodies against the primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies are used to detect and amplify the signals of primary antibodies in various assays, such as immunohistochemistry or Western blotting.</p></p>
