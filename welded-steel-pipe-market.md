<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welded Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Drawing Processing Technique</li><li>Hot Rolling Processing Technique</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Welded steel pipes come in two types - cold drawing and hot rolling processing techniques. Cold drawing involves pulling the steel through a die at room temperature, resulting in a smooth and precise finish. This technique is commonly used for smaller pipes and is cost-effective. On the other hand, hot rolling involves heating the steel above its recrystallization temperature and then passing it through rollers to achieve the desired shape. This technique is suitable for larger pipes and provides a higher level of strength and durability.</p></p>
