<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Floor Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Polyurethane Floor Paint</li><li>Non-Solvent Polyurethane Floor Paint</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane floor paint is available in two main types: solvent-based and non-solvent-based. Solvent polyurethane floor paint contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which aid in the drying process but also have environmental concerns. On the other hand, non-solvent polyurethane floor paint is formulated without VOCs, making it a more eco-friendly option. Both types provide a durable and protective coating for floors, but the choice between them depends on considerations such as environmental impact and desired drying time.</p></p>
