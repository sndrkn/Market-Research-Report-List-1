<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quarter-Turn Plug Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lubricated Plug Valves</li><li>Nonlubricated Plug Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Quarter-turn plug valves are used to control the flow of liquids or gases in various industries. The market for these valves can be categorized into two types: lubricated plug valves and nonlubricated plug valves. Lubricated plug valves are designed with a lubricant injected into the valve chamber to reduce friction and extend the valve's lifespan. On the other hand, nonlubricated plug valves are engineered to operate without the need for lubrication, reducing maintenance costs and potential contamination of the fluid. Both types offer effective flow control solutions for different applications.</p></p>
