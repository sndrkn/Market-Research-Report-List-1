<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy Topcoat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Base</li><li>Water Base</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Epoxy topcoat market can be classified into two types: solvent base and water base. Solvent-based epoxy topcoats contain volatile organic compounds and are applied using solvents like xylene or toluene. They offer higher levels of protection and durability but emit harmful fumes during application. On the other hand, water-based epoxy topcoats are environmentally friendly as they have low levels of VOCs. They are applied using water as a solvent, making them safer for both users and the environment, while still providing good protection and durability.</p></p>
