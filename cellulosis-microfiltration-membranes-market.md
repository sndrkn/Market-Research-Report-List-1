<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulosis Microfiltration Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross Flow</li><li>Direct Flow</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cellulose microfiltration membranes are widely used in various industries for filtration purposes. These membranes are categorized into two main types: cross flow and direct flow. </p><p>Cross flow filtration involves the continuous flow of the liquid to be filtered parallel to the membrane surface, allowing the smaller particles to pass through while retaining the larger particles. On the other hand, direct flow filtration involves the liquid passing directly through the membrane, resulting in the retention of both small and large particles. Both types have their unique applications and advantages in different industries.</p></p>
