<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Steam Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float type (Lever Float and Free Float)</li><li>Inverted Bucket type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical steam trap market includes two main types: float type (lever float and free float) and inverted bucket type. Float type steam traps use a float mechanism to control the flow of condensate and steam. Lever float traps rely on a lever to open and close the trap, while free float traps use a floating ball to regulate the flow. Inverted bucket traps, on the other hand, use an inverted bucket that moves up and down to open and close the trap based on the condensate level. These different types cater to diverse steam trap market needs.</p></p>
