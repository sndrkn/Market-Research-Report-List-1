<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Transport Refrigeration Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine transport refrigeration units are used to maintain a cool temperature inside the cargo holds of ships, ensuring the freshness and quality of perishable goods during transportation. In an open market system, the cooling system operates by drawing fresh air from the outside, which is then circulated inside the cargo hold. In a semi-closed market system, the cooling system uses a mix of fresh air and recirculated air from inside the cargo hold, providing better temperature control. Both systems play a vital role in preserving the integrity of temperature-sensitive goods during marine transport.</p></p>
