<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitinol-based Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent IVC Filters</li><li>Retrievable IVC Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Nitinol-based Filters market includes two main types: Permanent IVC Filters and Retrievable IVC Filters. Permanent IVC Filters are medical devices that are implanted permanently in the inferior vena cava to catch blood clots and prevent them from reaching the lungs. On the other hand, Retrievable IVC Filters are designed to be temporarily inserted and can be later removed when the risk of clotting has subsided. Both types of filters use Nitinol, a shape memory alloy, to ensure flexibility and effectiveness in capturing clots while maintaining the integrity of the blood vessels.</p></p>
