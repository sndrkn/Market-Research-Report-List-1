<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) Screening Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transent Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions</li><li>Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) Screening Systems are used to evaluate the function of the inner ear by measuring the sounds produced by the ear in response to sound stimulation. Transent Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) refers to the measurement of OAEs in response to brief tone bursts. Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) is another type of OAE measurement that assesses the response to two concurrent tones. Both TEOAE and DPOAE screening systems play a key role in assessing hearing abilities by detecting responses from the inner ear.</p></p>
