<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UAV Wankel Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled Wankel Engines</li><li>Air Cooled Wankel Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The UAV Wankel Engines market can be categorized into two types: Water Cooled Wankel Engines and Air Cooled Wankel Engines. Water Cooled Wankel Engines employ a cooling system that uses water to regulate the engine temperature, ensuring optimal performance and preventing overheating. On the other hand, Air Cooled Wankel Engines do not require water cooling and instead rely on air circulation to dissipate the heat generated during operation. Both types serve the same purpose of powering UAVs but differ in their cooling mechanisms.</p></p>
