<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oocyte Retrieval Needles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Lumen</li><li>Double Lumen</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Oocyte retrieval needles are used in assisted reproduction techniques to collect oocytes (eggs) from women. The market for these needles includes two types: single lumen and double lumen needles. Single lumen needles consist of a single channel through which oocytes are aspirated from the ovaries. On the other hand, double lumen needles have two separate channels, allowing for the simultaneous injection of a flushing medium to facilitate oocyte retrieval. Both types of needles serve the purpose of retrieving oocytes but differ in their design and functionality.</p></p>
