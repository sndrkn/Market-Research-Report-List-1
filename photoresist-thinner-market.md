<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Thinner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photo Resist</li><li>Negative Photo Resist</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photoresist thinner is a chemical solvent used in the semiconductor industry to dilute or thin photoresists, which are light-sensitive materials used in the photolithography process for creating circuit patterns on semiconductors. The market for photoresist thinner is divided into two main types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist is a type of photoresist that becomes soluble in the presence of light, allowing the exposed areas to be removed during development. Negative photoresist, on the other hand, becomes insoluble in light and remains after development.</p></p>
