<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IDS</li><li>IPS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Software (IDS, IPS) can be divided into two market types. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) software is designed to detect and provide alerts for any unauthorized or suspicious activities occurring within a network. It monitors network traffic and analyzes it for potential security breaches. On the other hand, IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) software not only detects but also actively prevents any intrusion attempts. It works by blocking malicious activities before they can harm the network. Both IDS and IPS play vital roles in securing networks from cyber threats.</p></p>
