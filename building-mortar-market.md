<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Mortar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Mixed Mortar</li><li>Dry Mortar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Building mortar market comprises two main types: wet mixed mortar and dry mortar. Wet mixed mortar, also known as ready-mix mortar, is produced by mixing the required proportion of cement, sand, and water at a manufacturing plant. It is then delivered to construction sites in a ready-to-use form, ensuring consistency and ease of application. On the other hand, dry mortar is a pre-mixed blend of cement, sand, and additives that only requires the addition of water on-site. It offers advantages such as longer shelf life, lower transportation costs, and greater flexibility in application.</p></p>
