<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Photocatalytic Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homogeneous Photocatalysis</li><li>Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning photocatalytic coatings are categorized into two main types: homogeneous photocatalysis and heterogeneous photocatalysis. Homogeneous photocatalysis refers to coatings where photocatalysts are mixed uniformly throughout the coating material, allowing for efficient decomposition of organic substances. On the other hand, heterogeneous photocatalysis involves coatings where the photocatalysts are immobilized on the surface, enabling the decomposition of organic materials upon contact. Both types offer effective self-cleaning properties by utilizing the power of light and photocatalytic reactions to break down pollutants and maintain cleanliness.</p></p>
